# MPI

It contains some MPI (developed using modern standards like C++11/14/17/20 and MPICH2) codes that I am presently working on. Those codes are developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 OS and with the mpic++ compiler. Tecplot or, VisIt is needed to visualize the output files. Output files appear within a directory named Output. LLNL Hypre library is required to run Helmholtz solvers using an iterative method.
